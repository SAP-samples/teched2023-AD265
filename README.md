# Bringing UI to the Next Level: Develop SAPUI5 with SAP Build Code

## SAP Build Code
Last year, SAP launched SAP Build to empower business experts to construct applications, implement automations and compose business sites. This year, the Build family is being expanded to offer a powerful shortcut for cloud application development with the introduction of **SAP Build Code**.

**SAP Build Code** unifies essential application development tools such as SAP Business Application Studio, SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), SAPUI5, SAP Mobile Services, and SAP Document Management Services. It is powered by the generative AI copilot, Joule, and enables interoperability with ABAP Cloud. Additionally, it facilitates seamless collaboration with SAP Build's low-code solutions and provides robust governance and lifecycle management features.

This hands-on exercise will assist you in learning how to **build SAPUI5 applications using SAP Build Code**.

## Description

Learn how to develop an SAPUI5 freestyle application using SAP Build Code, TypeScript, and the latest tools and best practices from SAP. In general, when using SAPUI5, you can decide whether you would like to implement applications using TypeScript or JavaScript. This tutorial, however, is exclusively using TypeScript. Don't be afraid, the difference is very small and not hard to understand.

## Exercises

Completing the following exercises will guide you through developing web applications using the SAPUI5 framework and TypeScript.
